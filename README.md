# Horizontal Doors
*Also known as* ***Bigger Trapdoors***

Avaible on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/horizontal-doors)

The Horizontal Doors mod brings a new dimension to Minecraft's building mechanics by introducing horizontally placed doors!
No longer limited to the vertical plane, you can now create unique entrances, hidden traps, secret passageways, or stylish skylights with doors that open horizontally.
These doors function just like regular doors,
but they open upwards or downwards, providing more flexibility and creativity in your builds.
Perfect for underground bases, hidden bunkers, or even decorative ceilings!
